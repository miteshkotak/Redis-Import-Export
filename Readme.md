Explanation of Changes:

Class Definition: Created a RedisExporter class to encapsulate the functionality.
Constructor: Added a constructor to initialize the source and destination Redis connections.

Methods: Split the functionality into separate methods (exportData, importData, and closeConnections) for better organization.

Usage: Updated the usage section to create an instance of RedisExporter and call the method to export and import the collection.

This structure improves readability and maintainability of the code.
